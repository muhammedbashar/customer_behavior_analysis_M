# End-to-End Data Analytics Project
## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights.
It combines Python-based analysis, SQL querying, and Power BI visualization to deliver a clear and actionable analytical outcome.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analyst skills used in real-world scenarios, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, database querying, dashboarding, and reporting.

## Dataset

* Source: Public / Provided dataset

* Format: CSV

* Description: The dataset contains structured business-related data used for analysis and visualization.

* Data was initially explored and cleaned using Python before being stored and queried in a MySQL database.

## Tools & Technologies

* Python (Pandas,sqlalchemy) – Data loading, EDA, and cleaning

* MySQL – Data storage and analytical SQL queries

* Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

* Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation

* Git & GitHub – Version control and project sharing

## Project Workflow

1- Data Loading

  * Imported raw dataset into Python using Pandas.

2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  * Examined data structure, distributions, and patterns.

  * Identified missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

3- Data Cleaning

  * Handled missing and duplicate records.
  
  * Standardized formats and corrected data types.
  
  * Prepared clean data for database insertion.

4- SQL Analysis

  * Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.

  * Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions.

5- Dashboard Development

  * Connected Power BI to MySQL.

  * Built an interactive dashboard with key KPIs, trends, and filters.

6- Reporting & Presentation

  * Created a structured analytical report.

  * Developed a presentation using Gamma to summarize insights and findings.

## Dashboard

* Interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing:

  * Key performance indicators (KPIs)

  * Trends and comparisons

  * Business insights derived from SQL and Python analysis

* Designed for clarity and decision-making support.

## Results & Insights

* Delivered clean, reliable data ready for analysis.

* Identified meaningful trends and patterns from the dataset.

* Transformed raw data into actionable business insights through visualization.

* Demonstrated the complete analytics lifecycle from data ingestion to presentation.


## How to Run This Project

1- Clone the repository:

  """git clone <repository-url>"""


2- Install required Python libraries:

  """pip install pandas sqlalchemy"""


3- Run the Python scripts to perform EDA and data cleaning.

4- Load the cleaned dataset into MySQL.

5- Execute the provided SQL queries.

6- Open the Power BI file and refresh the connection.

7- Review the report and presentation files for summarized insights.

## Key Takeaway

This project reflects my ability to work across Python, SQL, and BI tools to deliver an end-to-end data analytics solution aligned with business needs.
